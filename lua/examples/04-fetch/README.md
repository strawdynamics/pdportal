# pdportal-04-fetch

A slightly more practical example than 03-panic-sign, using GET and POST to integrate with https://restful-api.dev. It will create objects in this testing API. You can then view them on Playdate or your computer at https://api.restful-api.dev/objects/idLoggedToBrowserConsole.

## Installation

`./build.sh d` will compile and automatically install the app to your connected Playdate. I'm sorry, the script currently only works on macOS, and even then can be a bit janky. Pull requests welcome :)
